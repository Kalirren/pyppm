# pyppm/designs

All hardware designs are placed in subdirectories here. You will need
[gEDA gschem](http://www.geda-project.org/) and
[gEDA PCB](http://pcb.geda-project.org/) to view the raw design sources.

In any of the design subdirectories, you can run `./edit` to open the schematic
editor. To open the printed circuit board editor, run `./edit pcb` instead.

### Latest PyPPM board design

The latest PyPPMv1 board design is v1r3, located in `ppm-1.3`. The latest

### Coil designs

Coil designs are found in the `coil-X.Y` subdirectories.

### Case designs
